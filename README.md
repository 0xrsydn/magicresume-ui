# Magic Resume - Job Matching Platform (Frontend)

**Magic Resume** is job matching web app developed by [Zakir](https://github.com/zakirkun), [Alif](https://github.com/NnA301023), and me, powered by Llama3-8b as LLM on this app. Frontend we use here is NextJS.

Not really production grade, but you can clone this repo and do `npm install` then `npm run dev` to test the app as its working on development side to see how is the app work (not final product yet, will keep updating in the future).
